# Monkey Score (monkey_score)

A music composition Tool, that helps the musically challanged to get their melodies, harmonies and rythms from their mind to the page. Not all of us where cursed with perfect pitch and machine like timing. But we can overcome that by asking for more help and usability from our tools to fit our special needs. So that we also may inspire the world to be greater.
